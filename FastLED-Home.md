Welcome to FastLED.  This library aims to provide an efficient and abstracted high performance interface to various led controllers, as well as supporting LED programmers with a variety of other support libraries and functionality to keep things running as smoothly as possible.  Currently supporting arduino comparable avr and arm platforms, with more platforms to come on our roadmap.
